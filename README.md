# Used_car_price_prediction

Introduction:

Due to the many factors that influence a used carâ€™s price on the market, determining whether it is listed at the correct price can be a challenging task. This project intends to develop machine learning models that can accurately predict the prices of used cars based on their features which will assist insurances to offer better pricing models.

Code:

Using the Python 3.6 version of Python, we implemented and ran our code in Google Colab. 

Following are the steps to run and generate the code's results:

- Create a Google Collaborative Workspace for Used_car_price_prediction.ipynb
- Upload the dataset to the colab
- Run the code by running the cells sequentially
- There are comments in the cells indicating which libraries need to be installed. Install them by uncommenting and running the code
